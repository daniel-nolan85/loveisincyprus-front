          <h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            Love is in Cyprus is committed to protecting your privacy. We aim to
            provide trustworthy, industry-leading products and services so that
            you can focus on building meaningful connections. Our approach to
            privacy is to provide you with clear information about our data
            practices. That's why we've tried to keep legal and technical jargon
            to a minimum. This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, what
            types of cookies are placed on your device when you visit our
            website and how we use them. This Cookie Policy does not address how
            we deal with your personal information generally.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>What are cookies?</h4>
          <p>
            Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your
            web browser or your device's memory. A cookie typically contains the
            name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie
            originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and
            a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie
            also may contain information about your device, such as user
            settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using our
            services.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>First-party and third-party cookies</h4>
          <p>
            There are first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party
            cookies are placed on your device directly by us. For example, we
            use first-party cookies to adapt our website to your browser's
            language preferences and to better understand your use of our
            website. Third-party cookies are placed on your device by our
            partners and service providers. For example, we use third-party
            cookies to measure user numbers on our website or to enable you to
            share content with others across social media platforms.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Session and persistent cookies</h4>
          <p>
            There are session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies
            only last until you close your browser. We use session cookies for a
            variety of reasons, including to learn more about your use of our
            website during one single browser session and to help you to use our
            website more efficiently. Persistent cookies have a longer lifespan
            and aren't automatically deleted when you close your browser. These
            types of cookies are primarily used to help you quickly sign-in to
            our website again and for analytical purposes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Other technologies such as web beacons (also calls pixel tags or
            clear gifs), tracking URLs or software development kits (SDKs) are
            used for similar purposes. Web beacons are tiny graphics files that
            contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone
            has visited our service or opened an e-mail that we have sent them.
            Tracking URLs are custom generated links that help us understand
            where the traffic to our webpages comes from. SDKs are small pieces
            of code included in apps, which function like cookies and web
            beacons. For simplicity, we also refer to these technologies as
            “cookies” in this Cookie Policy.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>What do we use cookies for?</h4>
          <p>
            Like most providers of online services, we use cookies to provide,
            secure and improve our services, including by remembering your
            preferences, recognizing you when you visit our website and
            personalizing and tailoring ads to your interests. To accomplish
            these purposes, we also may link information from cookies with other
            personal information we hold about you. When you visit our website,
            some or all of the following types of cookies may be set on your
            device.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Essential website cookies</h4>
          <p>
            These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services
            available through our website and to use some of its features, such
            as access to secure areas.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Analytics cookies</h4>
          <p>
            These cookies help us understand how our website is being used, how
            effective marketing campaigns are, and help us customize and improve
            our websites for you.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Advertising cookies</h4>
          <p>
            These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to
            you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from
            continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed
            for advertisers, selecting advertisements that are based on your
            interests and measuring the number of ads displayed and their
            performance, such as how many people clicked on a given ad.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Social networking cookies</h4>
          <p>
            These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that
            you find interesting on our website through third-party social
            networking and other websites. These cookies may also be used for
            advertising purposes too.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>How can you control cookies?</h4>
          <p>
            There are several cookie management options available to you. Please
            note that changes you make to your cookie preferences may make
            browsing our website a less satisfying experience. In some cases,
            you may even find yourself unable to use all or part of our site.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Tools within this Cookie Policy</h4>
          <p>
            You can set and modify your cookie preferences at any time, by using
            the Cookie Management Preference Tool available at the top of this
            Cookies Policy.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Browser and devices controls</h4>
          <p>
            Some web browsers provide settings that allow you to control or
            reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your
            computer. The procedure for managing cookies is slightly different
            for each internet browser. You can check the specific steps in your
            particular browser help menu. You also may be able to reset device
            identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile
            device. The procedure for managing device identifiers is slightly
            different for each device. You can check the specific steps in the
            help or settings menu of your particular device.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Interest-based advertising tools</h4>
          <p>
            You can opt out of seeing online interest-based advertising from
            participating companies through the Digital Advertising Alliance,
            the Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance or Appchoices (apps
            only). Opting out does not mean you will not see advertising - it
            means you won't see personalized advertising from the companies that
            participate in the opt-out programs. Also, if you delete cookies on
            your device after you opted out, you will need to opt-out again.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Social Cookies</h4>
          <p>
            To allow you to share content on social media, some features of this
            website use social media plugins (e.g., Twitter™ “Share to Twitter”
            or LinkedIn™ “in” buttons). Depending on your social media account
            settings, we automatically receive information from the social media
            platform when you use the corresponding button on our website. To
            learn more about social media cookies, we suggest you refer to your
            social media platform's cookie policy and privacy policy.

          <h4>Adobe Flash Player™ Flash cookies</h4>
          <p>
            Adobe Flash Player™ is an application for viewing and interacting
            with dynamic content using the Flash platform. Flash (and similar
            applications) use a technology akin to cookies to memorize
            parameters, preferences and uses of this content. However, Adobe
            Flash Player manages this information and your choices via an
            interface separate from that supplied by your browser. If your
            terminal is likely to display content developed using the Flash
            platform, we suggest you access your Flash cookie management tools

          <p>
            If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained

            queue.
