            the Services as well as for the use of such means. Acceptance of

            optional or mandatory information as applicable. This information is
            published on the Site and shared with other Members through the
            Services. The distribution by the Member of his or her personal
            contact details (e-mail address, postal address, telephone, etc.) in
            his or her Profile description is expressly prohibited by Love is in

            elements or his/her Account, he/she must inform Love is in Cyprus
            immediately.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Subscription to the Services is paid for. The Member may purchase a
            Subscription and, thus, become a Subscriber and benefit from the
            functionalities of his/her Subscription. In order to do this, the
            Member must first identify him/herself using his/her email address,
            his/her mobile number and his/her confidential password. After
            choosing his/her Subscription and way of payment, the Member must
            submit his/her payment. This last step formally concludes the
            membership contract to the Paid Services and the complete,
            unreserved acceptance of the Terms of Use. Once the payment has been
            submitted, the Subscriber is directed to a payment confirmation
            page. Love is in Cyprus acknowledges receipt of the purchase of a
            Subscription by sending an email.
          </p>
          <h3>Article 3. Right to cancel</h3>
          <p>
            Pursuant to article 29 of the Consumer Contracts (Information,
            Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, the Member is
            informed that he/she has fourteen days from the purchase of a
            Subscription to exercise his/her right to cancel, without incurring
            any liability and without giving a reason from within the user
            settings menu, or by sending a clear statement requesting this to
            the e-mail address: customercare@loveisincyprus.com. Only requests
            relating to the exercise of this right to cancel will be processed
            from these contact addresses. In order for the cancellation to be
            effectively exercised, the Subscriber must send his/her request
            within the fourteen-day cancellation period. The Subscriber may, if
            he/she wishes to, access the Paid Services immediately without
            waiting for the end of the cancellation period, according to article
            36 (1) of the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and
            Additional Charges) Regulations 2013.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If the Subscriber does not wish to access the Paid Services
            immediately, he/she may leave the Website after submitting his/her
            payment and wait for the expiry of the fourteen-day period.
            Nevertheless, if the Subscriber connects to his/her Account and uses
            the Services before the end of the cancellation period, this first
            log in from the purchase of a Subscription constitutes an express
            request by the Subscriber to have immediate access to the Paid
            Services.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In any event, immediate access to the Services does not deprive the
            Subscriber from his/her right to cancel, which remains valid until
            the expiry of the fourteen-day period. Once their Subscription is
            paid, if the Subscriber does not access any of the Paid Services
            within the next 14 days, the Subscriber will be refunded and will
            have limited access to the Website features as unpaid user. The
            reimbursement shall be made within 14 days from the date Love is in
            Cyprus was informed of the Subscriber's decision to cancel, by the
            same means of payment which was used by the Subscriber for the
            initial transaction, save for any instruction from the latter to the
            contrary. The Subscriber will find additional information on the
            Help/Contact us page about the scope and application of the right to
            cancel.
          </p>

            can control, through his/her Account, the options which allow
            him/her to be visible or not on the Website and thus able to be
            contacted, if applicable, through those. A Member may access the
            Website provided that he/she satisfies the conditions applicable to
            Members of the Website.
