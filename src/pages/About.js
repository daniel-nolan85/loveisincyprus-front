          <h3>Why we are different</h3>
          <p>
            First and foremost, we are residents of Cyprus and enjoying life in
            this beautiful island that one might happily call{' '}
            <em>Fantasy Island</em> (in reference to the 1978 TV series) where
            dreams become reality!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            (Half) joking aside, being from various Western European
            backgrounds, having lived in the UK, in France, in Italy, and having
            travelled across the whole continent, Cyprus appears to us to be
            like a European microcosym with its communities of expats living
            alongside Greek Cypriot people.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As an idyllic setting, the birthplace of Aphrodite attracts every
            year so many tourists or people eager to settle here or who are
            simply inspired by this genuine 'love boat' on the Mediterranean
            Sea.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We want to offer a Dating Website specifically dedicated to the
            people residing in Cyprus, whether they are tourists or permanent
            residents, and who have serious plans in mind and heart to build a
            relationship wherever it can go.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Where it actually goes is part of the natural experiment and process
            that one calls life, and that's the beauty of it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Following our belief that love is both the most serious and precious
            matter on earth, we have built this website in the best possible way
            to help you find the right partner throughout our services and
            tools.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This dating site is designed to be, on one hand, country-specific
            (Love is <em>in</em> Cyprus), and on another hand an actual
            reflection of either the existing communities living here or usually
            coming here every year: mainly Brits, Russians, Greek-Cypriots, and
            a patchwork of various EU nationals, the kind of unique European
            happy cocktail that gives it its charm and magic...
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We sincerely hope you enjoy this new adventure and specific way to
            find a partner here in Cyprus, with Love is in Cyprus!
